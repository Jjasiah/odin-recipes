        <h3>Carne Asada served on a cutting board with lime and salt</h3>
        <p>Carne asada is a Mexican dish featuring steak that's marinated in a lime juice and seasonings mixture. 
            It literally translates to "grilled meat," so the steak is traditionally grilled.
        </p>
        <p>Making this carne asada marinade is so easy: Just combine all the ingredients in a bowl. 
            After your steak has marinated, pop it on a preheated grill and cook to your preferred doneness. 
            About 5 minutes on each side will yield a medium-rare steak. 
            Pour the reserved marinade over the steak and serve.
